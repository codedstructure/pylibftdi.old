libFTDI itself is developed by Intra2net AG.  No association with
Intra2net is claimed or implied, but I have found their library
helpful and had fun with it...

History
-------
At least two other open-source Python FTDI wrappers exist, and each
of these may be best for some projects.

ftd2xx - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ftd2xx
 - ctypes binding to FTDI's own D2XX driver
pyftdi - http://git.marcansoft.com/?p=pyftdi.git
 - a C extension libftdi binding

pylibftdi exists in the gap between these two projects; ftd2xx uses
the (closed-source) D2XX driver, but provides a high-level Python
interface, while pyftdi works with libftdi but is very low-level.
The aim for pylibftdi is to work with the libftdi, but to provide
a high-level Pythonic interface.  Various wrappers and utility
functions are also part of the distribution; following Python's
batteries included approach, there are various interesting devices
supported out-of-the-box.


Changes
-------

0.2
 * fixed various bugs
 * added ftdi_fn and set_baudrate functions in Driver class
 * changed interface in BitBangDriver to direction/port properties
   rather than overriding the read/write functions, which are therefore
   still available as in the Driver class.
0.1
 * first release. Tested with libftdi 0.18 on Mac OS X 10.6 and Linux
  (stock EEEPC 701 Xandros Linux, Ubuntu 10.04)
