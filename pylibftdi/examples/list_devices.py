"""
Report connected FTDI devices. This may be useful in obtaining
serial numbers to use as the device_id parameter of the Device()
constructor to communicate with a specific device when more than
one is present.

example usage:

    $ python pylibftdi/examples/list_devices.py
    FTDI:UB232R:FTAS1UN5
    FTDI:UM232R USB <-> Serial:FTE4FFVQ

To open a device specifically to communicate with the second of
these devices, the following would be used:

    >>> from pylibftdi import Device
    >>> dev = Device(device_id="FTE4FFVQ")
    >>>
