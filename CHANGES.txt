pylibftdi changes
=================

0.9pre
 * improved and extended tests
 * added some Sphinx-based documentation
 * allow the PID/VID to be changed
 * add new example - basic web server to toggle / read IO bits
0.8.1
 * fix issue with bitbang following API changes in 0.8
 * add tests for bitbang mode
 * refactor tests; fix text-based tests in Python3
 * slight refactor Device() to improve testability (_read and _write methods)
0.8
 * added some unit tests
 * API changes:
   - when opening a device with a device_id parameter, this will now check
     against both serial number and (if that fails), the device description.
     Opening by device type (under the same proviso that an arbitrary device
     will be selected if multiple matching devices are attached as when no
     device_id is given) is frequently easier than matching by serial number.
   - added flush(), flush_input() and flush_output() operations. This is
     modelled after the pySerial API providing separate flush operations, and
     gets the Device API closer to that of files.
   - increased file-API compatibility, with line-oriented methods and iteration
0.7
 * support multiple attached devices
 * API changes:
   - separation between driver and device. Generally, now use Device() /
     BitBangDevice() rather than Driver / BitBangDriver(), though older code
     _should_ still work via some shims (though with Deprecation warnings).
   - first parameter in Device() and BitBangDevice() is a device ID - the serial
     number string of the target device.
   - open() is generally no longer required on Devices. This is to more closely
     model the file() API.
0.6
 * same source now works on both Python2.6+ and Python3.
0.5
 * fix various bugs found by pyflakes
 * improve module organisation, while providing interface compatibility
0.4.1
 * fix release issue
0.4
 * fixed embarrassing bug which caused things not to work on Linux 
   (is now find_library('ftdi') instead of find_library('libftdi'))
 * lots of error checking, new FtdiError exception. Before it just
   tended to segfault if things weren't just-so.
 * get_error() is now get_error_string().  It's still early enough
   to change the API, and if I thought it was get_error_string
   multiple times when I wrote the error checking code, it probably
   should be the more natural thing.
0.3
 * added some examples
 * new Bus class in pylibftdi (though it probably belongs somewhere else)
 * first release on PyPI
0.2
 * fixed various bugs
 * added ftdi_fn and set_baudrate functions in Driver class
 * changed interface in BitBangDriver to direction/port properties
   rather than overriding the read/write functions, which are therefore
   still available as in the Driver class.
0.1
 * first release. Tested with libftdi 0.18 on Mac OS X 10.6 and Linux
  (stock EEEPC 701 Xandros Linux, Ubuntu 10.04)
